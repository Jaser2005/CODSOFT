📊 Customer Churn Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn during my Machine Learning Internship at CodSoft.
Used a structured telecom dataset to analyze customer behavior and identify potential churners.
The workflow included:
1) Data preprocessing,
2) Exploratory data analysis (EDA),
3) Feature selection,
4) Model training, and
5) Performance evaluation using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
This project enhanced my understanding of supervised learning, model optimization, and real-world data handling for business decision-making.

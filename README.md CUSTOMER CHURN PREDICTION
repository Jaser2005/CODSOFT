CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship

During this internship, I developed and implemented multiple machine learning projects focused on real-world problem solving, including Spam SMS Detection, Customer Churn Prediction, and Credit Card Fraud Detection.
These projects strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
